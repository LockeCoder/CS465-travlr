# CS465 Travlr (Express)

Travlr Getaways is a static website served through a Node.js and Express server. This repository represents the Module 1 milestone for SNHU CS-465, where the initial client-facing shell is rendered in the browser and organized using the Express framework.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express
- HTML / CSS (static pages + assets)

## Project Structure (Key Paths)
- `public/` — Static site content served by Express
  - `public/index.html` — Homepage
  - `public/css/` — Stylesheets
  - `public/images/` — Images and UI assets
- `routes/` — Express routes
- `app.js` — Express app configuration

## Run Locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

## Start the server
npm start

## Open in your browser
http://localhost:3000/index.html

## Notes
- The homepage is configured to load at the root route (/) for a cleaner, portfolio-ready experience.
- This is the starting point for expanding the application into a full stack MEAN-based project in later modules.
## Then commit + push:

```powershell
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README"
git push
